### The expression `/(\d+(\.\d+)?)%/g` is a regular expression (regex) used to match patterns in a string. Let's break it down

- `/ ... /`: This denotes the start and end of the regular expression.
- `\d+`: This matches one or more digits. `\d` is a shorthand for any digit (0-9), and `+` means one or more of the preceding element.
- `(\.\d+)?`: This matches an optional decimal part.
  - `\.` matches a literal dot (decimal point).
  - `\d+` matches one or more digits following the decimal point.
  - `()` groups these parts together.
  - `?` means the grouped part is optional (it may occur zero or one time).
- `%`: This matches the literal percent symbol.
- `g`: This is a flag meaning "global," which indicates that the regex should match all occurrences in the string, not just the first one.

In simpler terms, this regex matches:

- Any number of digits (`\d+`), optionally followed by a decimal part (`(\.\d+)?`), and then a percent symbol (`%`).

For example:

- `80%` matches `80` followed by `%`.
- `80.5%` matches `80.5` followed by `%`.

Here's what each part does in the context of the `replace` function in your code:

```javascript
num1 = num1.replace(/(\d+(\.\d+)?)%/g, function(match, p1) {
  return (parseFloat(p1) / 100).toString();
});
```

- `num1.replace(...)`: This function is used to replace parts of the string that match the regex.
- `/(\d+(\.\d+)?)%/g`: The regex pattern to match numbers followed by a percent symbol.
- `function(match, p1) { return (parseFloat(p1) / 100).toString(); }`: This is a replacement function that takes each match and converts the percentage to its decimal form.
  - `match`: The entire matched string (e.g., `80%`).
  - `p1`: The first capturing group, which is the number part of the match (e.g., `80` or `80.5`).
  - `parseFloat(p1) / 100`: Converts the number to a float and divides by 100 to convert it to a decimal (e.g., `80` becomes `0.8`).
  - `.toString()`: Converts the resulting number back to a string.
